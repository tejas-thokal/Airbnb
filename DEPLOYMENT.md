# Netlify Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploying to Netlify

Your Airbnb clone is now configured for proper deployment on Netlify with client-side routing support.

### 📁 Files Created for Netlify

1. **`public/_redirects`** - Handles client-side routing
2. **`public/_headers`** - Security headers and caching
3. **`netlify.toml`** - Netlify configuration
4. **`vite.config.js`** - Updated for production builds

### 🔧 Deployment Steps

#### Option 1: Drag & Drop (Recommended)
1. Run `npm run build` to create the `dist` folder
2. Drag the `dist` folder to Netlify's deploy area
3. Your site will be live with proper routing!

#### Option 2: Git Integration
1. Push your code to GitHub/GitLab
2. Connect your repository to Netlify
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist`
5. Deploy!

### ✅ What's Fixed

- **Client-side routing** now works on Netlify
- **Direct URL access** to `/property/:id` works

### 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

After deployment, test these URLs:

### 🔍 Troubleshooting

If you still see "Page Not Found":
