# Map Issue Fix in WishlistPropertyDetail

## Problem

The map in the WishlistPropertyDetail page was showing "Location not available" error because the saved wishlist items were missing latitude and longitude coordinates (`lat` and `lng` properties).

## Solution

The issue has been fixed by implementing the following changes:

1. **Enhanced MapView Component**:
   - Added detailed logging to help diagnose coordinate issues
   - Improved error messages to be more specific about what's missing
   - Added validation to check if flats is an array

2. **Enhanced WishlistPropertyDetail Component**:
   - Added code to enrich wishlist items with coordinates from the original data sources
   - The component now looks up missing coordinates from puneFlats and mumbaiFlats arrays
   - Added a back button for better navigation when no data is available

3. **Improved PropertyinDetails Component**:
   - Enhanced the saveToWishlist function to ensure coordinates are saved
   - Added logging to verify coordinates are being saved
   - Added code to update existing wishlist items with coordinates

## How It Works

When a user views a property in their wishlist:

1. The WishlistPropertyDetail component checks if the property has coordinates
2. If coordinates are missing, it searches for them in the original data sources
3. The enriched data is then passed to the MapView component
4. The MapView component filters for valid coordinates and displays the map

## Testing

To test this fix:

1. Clear your existing wishlists (optional)
2. Add new properties to your wishlist
3. View the wishlist and click on a property
4. The map should now display correctly

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding a fallback map center for cases where no coordinates are available
2. Implement a more robust coordinate lookup system
3. Add error boundaries to handle map rendering failures gracefully
